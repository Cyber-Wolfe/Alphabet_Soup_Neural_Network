# Alphabet Soup Neural Network

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to understand whether a neural network can predict, from a provided dataset, if applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results

The beginning DataFrame after file export had looked like the image below, and needed some immediate cleaning and direction for our model to begin:

* The target of this data set was the "IS-SUCCESSFUL" column of the data set.

* The features would be the rest of the dataset.

* This is barring EIN, Name, and ASK_AMT becuase they will be removed from the dataset.

The final DataFrame now looks like the image below after cleaning:
